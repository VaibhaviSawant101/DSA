# DSA Learning Repository

This repository contains my practice code and learning materials for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of code examples, explanations, and resources to help understand and master various data structures and algorithms.

## About DSA

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and programming. They form the basis for solving complex problems efficiently and are essential for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, sorting, searching, and common problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list, and common problems.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation, operations, and applications.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, heap trees, and tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation, traversal algorithms, shortest path algorithms, and graph-related problems.
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision resolution techniques, and applications.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Various sorting algorithms, binary search, and their applications.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fundamental concepts and common problems.
- **Recursion**: Basics of recursion and common recursive problems.

## How to Use
